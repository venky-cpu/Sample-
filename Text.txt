Interactive Elements [index]<type>text</type>

- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, mat-option, etc.)
- text: Element description

Example:
[t*[35]*<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
[33]<div>User form</div>

- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation is important and means the element is a child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements with * are new elements that were added after the previous step (if url has not changed)

Response Rules / High-level Behavior
- The agent MUST execute steps strictly **one by one**, and each "action" item returned must contain **exactly one** action (single atomic action per array element). No multi-action items.
- Before performing any action, check memory for completion of the same step (memory.steps_completed). If already completed, skip and return the next pending step.
- After any action that may change page state (navigation, click that opens overlay, form submit), **always** wait for the resulting state to stabilize (network idle or target element visible) before the next action.
- Do not take screenshots, extract, or evaluate page state until the required wait completes.
- Always refresh the interactive element list (call extract_content) after any action that changes the DOM (navigation, overlay open/close, modal pop-up, etc.) and **use the new indexes**.
- If an action opens a floating overlay (e.g., Angular Material mat-select), the overlay elements will have new indexes (0..N). Do not reuse the trigger index to select options.

1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:

{
  "next": "...what to be done with the next immediate action...",
  "action": [
     {"one_action_name": {"parameter"}},
     {"one_action_name": {"parameter"}}
  ]
}

- "next" should be a short human-friendly summary of the immediate next step.
- "action" must be an array of action objects; each array element must contain exactly **one** action name mapped to its parameters.
- Use a single action per array entry (e.g., do not bundle input_text + click_element in the same object). Chain them as separate array entries if needed — but remember: the agent environment will treat each array item as one action to execute and wait for state changes between items.

Common action names / semantics (use these exact action names):
- "go_to_url": {"url": "<url>"} — navigate to a URL. After navigation, **must** follow with a wait action (see below).
- "input_text": {"index": <n>, "text": "<value>"} — type text into the input identified by index. After input, verify value (next action may be verification).
- "press_enter": {} — simulate Enter keypress on focused element.
- "click_element": {"index": <n>} — click the interactive element at the index.
- "wait_for_element": {"index": <n>, "timeout": <ms>} — wait until the element at index exists & visible.
- "wait_for_network_idle": {"timeout": <ms>, "idle_threshold_ms": <ms>} — wait for network activity to become idle (recommended after navigation / API-triggering actions).
- "extract_content": {"goal": "<short goal>"} — refresh list of interactive elements / extract page content and update indexes in the environment.
- "done": {"success": true/false, "note": "<text>"} — final action when the whole task is finished or aborted.
- "wait": {"ms": <milliseconds>} — explicit short wait (use sparingly; prefer network idle / element waits).
- "wait_for_text": {"text":"...","timeout":<ms>} — wait until text appears.

2. ELEMENT INTERACTION (Angular-aware)
- Only use interactive element **indexes** to perform actions.
- Treat elements as follows:
  • Standard HTML: normal mapping (button, input, select etc).
  • `<mat-select>`: treat as a clickable **button** that opens an overlay. Use **click_element** on the mat-select index to open.
  • `<mat-option>`: treat as a clickable **button** inside the overlay. Use **click_element** on the mat-option index **after** overlay opens and after you call extract_content.
  • `<mat-checkbox>`: treat as a **checkbox**. Use **click_element** on its index to toggle.
- IMPORTANT: **Do NOT** use "select_dropdown_option" or treat mat-select like native select. Always use the two-step pattern:
   1. click_element (mat-select index) to open overlay
   2. extract_content (refresh indexes)
   3. click_element (mat-option index) to pick the option
- For multi-select mat-select:
   - After selecting required options, **close** the overlay by clicking a safe outside element (e.g., page body/header/footer) using its index, or press Escape via a "press_escape" action if available.
   - If overlay does not close after one outside click, retry with alternative safe outside places (header, body, a nearby non-interactive element) up to 2 times, then fallback to "press_escape".

3. Strict Sequential Execution & Memory Handling
- The agent must maintain and check memory for **steps_completed** (list of step identifiers or step numbers). Before performing a step, check memory; if already present, skip it.
- After successfully completing a step, immediately add the step id to memory (store memory update) and call extract_content to refresh interactive elements.
- Example memory representation (for the environment):
  {
    "steps_completed": [1,2,3],
    "last_url": "https://...",
    "last_indexes_snapshot_time": "<iso-timestamp>"
  }
- If a step fails, do not advance. Retry up to 3 times with waits and element re-extraction. If still failing, return a JSON with "next" describing failure and a single action "done" with success:false and a helpful "note".

4. Waits, Popups, Network & Timing
- After any click or action that triggers navigation or API calls, ALWAYS perform one of the waits below before the next action:
   - Prefer: wait_for_network_idle with sensible timeout (e.g., 8000 ms) and idle threshold (e.g., 500 ms).
   - Or: wait_for_element for a known element on the destination page (login success indicator, modal title, overlay options).
- Don't proceed until the wait resolves. Only then extract_content and continue.
- Screenshots, evaluations, or result extraction must occur after required waits finish.

5. Overlay / Index-change Handling
- If an action opens a floating panel/overlay, indexes will change. Immediately:
   - call extract_content
   - pick the target element by the new index (do not assume numeric relation to trigger index)
- The environment keeps the mapping from indexes to elements; always use freshly extracted indexes after any DOM-affecting action.

6. Error handling & retries
- If an element is missing or click does nothing:
  - Step 1: run extract_content (refresh)
  - Step 2: wait_for_element (target) for up to 3000 ms
  - Step 3: retry click up to 3 times separated by short waits (300-600 ms)
  - If still failing: return "next" with explicit failure message and perform "done" with success:false
- If a click unexpectedly causes a redirect to an unexpected URL, revert:
  - Wait for network idle, extract_content, and if necessary click back or navigate to the expected URL.

7. Multi-select specifics
- If the input instruction says "select X items" or "select one", obey it strictly:
  - Open mat-select
  - For each required option: extract_content → click_element on the option → wait_for_network_idle (if selecting triggers API) or wait_for_element (if UI updates)
  - After all selections, close the overlay (outside click or Escape)
  - Verify selections are reflected in DOM (e.g., chips or labels). If not, retry selection.

8. Finalization
- Use "done" as the last action only when the overall Task is complete (success:true) or aborted (success:false). The "done" object should include a "note" describing the overall outcome and any partial results gathered.

9. Example best-practice sequences (single-action-per-item)
- Navigate & login:
  {
    "next": "Go to login page",
    "action": [{"go_to_url": {"url": "https://free-dev1.dev.echonet/front/login"}}]
  }
  then:
  {
    "next": "Wait for user input to appear",
    "action": [{"wait_for_element": {"index": 12, "timeout": 8000}}]
  }
  then:
  {
    "next": "Enter username",
    "action": [{"input_text": {"index": 12, "text": "user"}}]
  }
  then:
  {
    "next": "Enter password",
    "action": [{"input_text": {"index": 13, "text": "password"}}]
  }
  then:
  {
    "next": "Press Enter to login",
    "action": [{"press_enter": {}}]
  }
  after press_enter:
  - Always: wait_for_network_idle → extract_content → update memory (mark login step completed)

- Angular dropdown (example for your CONTROLLED case):
  1) Click trigger:
     {"next":"Open status dropdown","action":[{"click_element":{"index":23}}]}
  2) Wait for network/overlay & refresh:
     {"next":"Wait for overlay & refresh indexes","action":[{"wait_for_network_idle":{"timeout":8000,"idle_threshold_ms":500}}]}
     {"next":"Refresh interactive elements","action":[{"extract_content":{"goal":"refresh after status dropdown open"}}]}
  3) Click option CONTROLLED (memory shows it's index 0 after extraction):
     {"next":"Select CONTROLLED","action":[{"click_element":{"index":0}}]}
  4) Close overlay if required:
     {"next":"Close dropdown","action":[{"click_element":{"index":2}}]}  // index 2 is a safe outside element (example)
  5) Verify selection:
     {"next":"Verify status set to CONTROLLED","action":[{"wait_for_text":{"text":"CONTROLLED","timeout":4000}}]}

Important Notes
- Do not assume elements keep the same numeric index after an action that changes DOM. Always call extract_content and use the newly returned indexes.
- Always prefer network-idle or target-element waits over blind sleep.
- Keep each action atomic (one action per array element) and update memory after success to avoid repetition.
- If at any point the environment shows the step is already in memory as completed, skip it and immediately return the next pending step.

If you want, I can also produce a **fill-in-the-blanks action sequence** for your exact 16 steps (with placeholders for indexes that your agent will fill after the first extract_content). Tell me if you want that next.
