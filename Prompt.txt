Scenario: Create a person with mandatory fields via UI

Given I am on the OPAL "People" dashboard

When I click the "Create Person" button

And I fill in the following mandatory fields:

| field

| value

| First Name

John

Last Name

| Doe

Email

| john.doe@echonet.com|

Employee ID

And I click the "Submit" button

Then I should see a success message "Person created successfully"

And the new person should appear in the "People Search" with status "Active"

And the person's details should match the input data
